# 🧑‍⚖️ Legal Assistant Chatbot – Proof of Concept (POC)

## 📘 Project Scenario

You are part of a Law Firm where your colleagues rely on your technical expertise to enhance the quality and efficiency of their daily work.

The top management has set an ambitious goal:

> ⚡ Increase lawyer productivity by 50% — meaning the firm should be able to handle 50% more case studies, ultimately boosting overall profitability.

As a first step toward this goal, you propose to develop a Lawyer Assistant Chatbot designed to accelerate lawyers’ daily research, drafting, and case analysis tasks.

Management supports your vision and has requested a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate the feasibility, performance, and potential impact of such a solution.

## 🎯 Your Mission

You are asked to design and implement a functional POC of the Legal Assistant Chatbot. Specifically, you should:

### 1. 🧱 Design a Solution Architecture
- Draft a design pattern or system architecture for the chatbot.
- Clearly show how each component interacts (retrieval, generation, interface, and evaluation).

### 2. 🔍 Implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline
- Use law-related texts from your preferred legal domain (e.g., corporate law, criminal law, intellectual property, etc.).
- Integrate retrieval and generation steps to ensure accurate and context-aware responses.

### 3. 📊 Design an Evaluation Framework
- Define and implement an evaluation pipeline for both:
  - Retrieval quality 
  - Generation quality 

### 4. 💬 Build a Simple Chatbot Interface
- Create a minimal user interface to demonstrate the chatbot in action.
- Integrate all components (RAG + evaluation) into a working prototype.

Your final submission should include:

### 1. 📑 Approach Presentation
- Overview of your architecture, implementation approach, and evaluation/observability strategy.

### 2. 🎥 Demo Video
