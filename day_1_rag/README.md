# Day 1: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

This module introduces Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with large language models to create more accurate, knowledge-grounded AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of RAG architecture
- Master different retrieval approaches (bi-encoder, cross-encoder, reranking)
- Build a complete RAG pipeline with AWS Bedrock
- Evaluate RAG system performance using key metrics
- Apply best practices for production RAG systems

## Exercises

### 1. Bi-Encoder vs Cross-Encoder (`1_bi_cross_encoder.ipynb`)

**What you'll learn:**
- Difference between bi-encoder and cross-encoder architectures
- Implement cosine similarity for semantic search
- Compare performance trade-offs between approaches
- Understand when to use each method in production

**Key concepts:** Embeddings, semantic similarity, retrieval speed vs accuracy

### 2. Advanced RAG Pipeline (`2_advanced_rag.ipynb`)

**What you'll learn:**
- Build a complete RAG system using LangChain and AWS Bedrock
- Implement intelligent document chunking strategies
- Create and query vector databases with FAISS
- Visualize embeddings in 2D space
- Combine retrieval and generation workflows

**Key concepts:** Document processing, vector databases, embedding visualization, prompt engineering


---

### 3. Reranking for Improved Retrieval (`3_reranking.ipynb`)

**What you'll learn:**
- Implement two-stage retrieval (retrieve + rerank)
- Use ColBERT for reranking retrieved documents
- Measure the impact of reranking on result quality
- Optimize K values for different stages
- Integrate reranking into existing RAG pipelines

**Key concepts:** Two-stage retrieval, ColBERT, ranking optimization, hybrid approaches
